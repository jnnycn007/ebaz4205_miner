EBAZ4205 Bitcoin miner board

These boards became available at a very attractive price in late 2020.
They contain a Xilinx ZYNQ XC7Z010 chip, which contains a dual core ARM
(Cortex-A9) that runs at 667 Mhz along with the usual peripherals, and
above all else a substantial FPGA.

This repository contains my research efforts with the board I have.
Ultimately I will be doing bare metal programming and things of
that sort.

Most of my notes are on my website:
